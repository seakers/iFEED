	    	<h1>Definition of a feature</h1>

			<p>Feature is a description of a pattern that can be found among the target designs (highlighted in blue). 
			Below are some examples of what features might look like: </p>
            
            <ul><li>OCE_SPEC is assigned to LEO-600-polar</li>
            <li>AERO_LID and CHEM_UVSPEC are assigned together in the same orbit</li>
            <li>Orbit SSO-800-PM is empty</li>
            <li>HYP_ERB is assigned to either LEO-600-polar or SSO-600-AM</li></ul>
            
            <p>Some of these features are better than others in explaining the target designs. 
            We use two different criteria to define the goodness of a feature: Coverage and Specificity</p>

	    </div>
	    <div id="feature_coverage" class="textContainer">
	    	<h1>Coverage</h1>

	    	<div>
	    		<p>The Venn diagram on the right shows the relative sizes of different sets of designs. </p>
				<p>The blue circle represents the set of designs that are marked as the targets. 
				The red circle represents the set of designs that satisfy a certain feature. </p>
				<p>Coverage is defined as: (# of designs in the intersection) / (# of designs in the target)</p>
				<p>A feature with high coverage means that it can explain most of the target designs. 
				The Venn diagram shown on the right corresponds to high coverage, as the intersection covers most of the target (blue circle).</p>
	    	</div>
	    	<img src="img/venndiagram_coverage.png">
	    </div>
	    <div id="feature_specificity" class="textContainer">
	    	<h1>Specificity</h1>

	    	<div>
				<p>Specificity is defined as: (# of designs in the intersection) / (# of designs that have the feature)</p>
				<p>A feature with high specificity means that most of the designs with the feature are in the target. 
				The Venn diagram on the right corresponds to high specificity, as the intersection covers most of the designs with the selected feature (pink circlr).</p>
	    	</div>
	    	<img src="img/venndiagram_precision.png">

	    </div>
	    <div id="feature_summary" class="textContainer">
	    	<h1>Summary</h1>

	    	<div>
				<p>An ideal feature would have both high coverage and high specificity, 
				as shown on the Venn diagram on the right.</p>
				<p>This feature has both high coverage and high specificity, as the feature covers most of the target designs and 
				does not cover other non-target designs. </p>
				<p>In other words, the intersection covers most of the blue circle as well as the red circle.</p>

				<p>The key is finding the right balance between these two criteria. During the task, try to look for features that:</p>
                <p> <b>(1) are shared by at least 70% of the target designs (coverage of 0.7 or higher)</b></p>
                <p> <b>(2) and maximizes both coverage and specificity.</b></p>
